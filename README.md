We had a task within Software Verification and Validation course, focusing on software testing and preparing students for future in QA testing, to choose a web platform and test both its functional, as well as non-functional features. We chose OLX, an e-commerce platform. 

In this repository NUnit test will be found, as well as a full report on the task. Other than NUnit tests, my teammates and I created an Azure DevOps ogranisation, manually testing and finding bugs on OLX. Also, we wrote API tests, utilized Selenium IDE for recorded tests, as well as Apache JMeter for designing and executing load and stress tests. 

For more details, check out the report in "Dokumentacija" folder.
